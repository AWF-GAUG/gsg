Description: The package provides functions for generating a global sampling 
  grid that can be used for land-cover assessments. The characterisitcs of the 
  grid are a constant sampling intensity, a constant distance between sampling 
  locations along latitudes, and constant distance between circles of latitudes. 
  The package contains a shiny app for displaying and downloading generated 
  grids.
